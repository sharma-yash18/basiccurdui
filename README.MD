# User Information Management System

This project is a simple web application that allows users to add, edit, and delete their personal information (name, mobile, and city). The application uses **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** along with **Bootstrap** for styling and layout. It stores the user data locally in the browser using **localStorage**.
